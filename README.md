# Getting Started with MatchUP

MatchUp is a web application which creates a matching service that connects placement students with potential employers, in a similar way to dating services. The main objective is to provide a safe way for students to get the best possible job and for companies to find the most suitable people for their specific job. It allows making this whole placement process easier and more efficient for both students and employers.

# How to start?

Since this project is implemented in the form of a web application, it makes it self-explanatory and quite easy to use. However, if you have any ambiguities we will be more than willing to instruct you in the main steps you need to follow to take advantage of this application. If you have any problems or concerns regarding the application you can contact us at any time.

Let's start!

## Register and add some basic informations

If you are already a registered user, just simply click on the login button in the navigation bar. In case you still did not register yet, there is a link that will lead you to the simple form where you can add your basic information. You can either log in as a student or as a company.

# Getting Started with MatchUP

MatchUp is a web application which creates a matching service that connects placement students with potential employers, in a similar way to dating services. The main objective is to provide a safe way for students to get the best possible job and for companies to find the most suitable people for their specific job. It allows making this whole placement process easier and more efficient for both students and employers.

# How to start?

Since this project is implemented in the form of a web application, it makes it self-explanatory and quite easy to use. However, if you have any ambiguities we will be more than willing to instruct you in the main steps you need to follow to take advantage of this application. If you have any problems or concerns regarding the application you can contact us at any time at [info@pladat.tk](mailto:info@pladat.tk).

Let's start!

## Register and add some basic informations

If you are already a registered user, just click on the login button in the navigation bar. In case you did not register yet, there is a link that will lead you to the simple form where you can add your basic information. You can either log in as a student or as a company.

# Student
## Add skills

When you are registered and logged in as a student, dashboard with recomended jobs will show up. As you can see from the picture below there are couple of filters that can help you in searching your dream job. All the jobs are ranked in a way that fits your skills and needs.

## Your dashboard is empty and it does not offers any jobs?

Do not worry! You just need to add more information about yourself and add more skills. You can do that by clicking on the link "Profile details" like it is shown in the picture below.

After choosing the right job you can apply by simply clicking button and wait for the respond from the company. In the dashboard page you will have a notification when the status of your offer is resolved, whether it is positive or negative. If you want to test it on your own you can create student account, apply for the job and you will get a response from the company during the day.

If you want, you can contact the company via email, the option is stated in the same place as notifications.

# Company
## Add job

When you are registered and logged in as a company, an empty dashboard will show up with a button to add a new job. After the button is pressed a simple form with the job name and description needs to be filled in order to add a job. After that, new form with much more fields will show up. Here the companies can add skills, location, and some other important information for the job.
